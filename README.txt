ANALYSIS:
Through the testing that we did, we found that the types of files that would lead to the greatest amount of compression
were usually files that had characters that would repeat in much greater frequencies than other characters, This would
be because the more frequent characters would have shorter codes leading to less data needing to be written. 

On the other hand, we found that whenever a file had the majority of its characters be distinct or not commonly repeated, 
it would not not compress as much or at all, as if the majority of the characters had the the same frequencies, they would 
have similar huffman code lengths which would lead to them having less compression on average as the code length would be more 
similar to the original length. Additionally, we observed that very small files might actually be expanded using huffman compression,
which is clearly observed in the smallText file "Eerie eyes seen near lake." as when the file was compressed it would actually be 
bigger that it originally was.

We also found that when we tried to compress a file which was already compressed using the huffman algorithm, the amount of 
compression that would actually occur was usually minimal or negligible, since the algorithm for building codes is based on
frequencies and the frequencies of specific bit sequences would be about the same, leading to little to no compression taking
place.
